## Benjamin Matthews, PhD 
### Lab Head and Assistant Professor

Ben received a BS in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 2004 and completed his graduate research at Columbia University in the Laboratory of [Wes Grueber](https://grueberlab.neuroscience.columbia.edu) where he worked on the phenomenon of 'self-avoidance' during the development of sensory neuron dendritic arbors in *Drosophila melanogaster*. He then completed his postdoctoral training with [Leslie Vosshall](https://www.rockefeller.edu/research/2355-vosshall-laboratory/) at Rockefeller University/HHMI, where he focused on genetics, genomics, and behavior in the mosquito *Aedes aegypti*, a deadly vector of arbivoral pathogens that cause Zika, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, and Chikungunya. He received postdoctoral fellowships from the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research and The Rockefeller University, as well as a predoctoral NRSA F31 from the NIH.<br/>

At UBC, Ben is an Assistant Professor in the Comparative Physiology Group of the [Department of Zoology](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca). He is also a member of the [Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health](https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca), the [Biodiversity Research Centre](https://biodiversity.ubc.ca/) and the [Genome Science and Technology](https://www.gsat.ubc.ca) training program. He has received a Sloan Foundation Fellowship in the Neurosciences and a Scholar Award from the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. <br/><br/>

## Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students

{: #jeff }

### Jean-François (Jeff) Doherty, PhD

### Postdoctoral Fellow (2022-present)

Jeff received his PhD from the University of Otago, where he studied the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions. He is a joint-appointed postdoctoral fellow with [Leonard Foster's lab](https://fosterlab.msl.ubc.ca/) and will be working on how parasites can manipulate the behaviour of their host(s) using transcriptomic, proteomic, and quantitative behavioural techniques.

{: #ian }

### Ian Bouyoucos, PhD

### Postdoctoral Fellow (2023-present)

Ian recently completed postdoctoral training at the University of Manitoba where he researched functional evolution of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis in chondrichthyan fishes. He received his PhD from James Cook University and École Pratique des Hautes Études where he studied ecophysiology in reef sharks in the context of climate change. In the Matthews and Brauner labs, Ian studies the effects of aquatic acidification and habitat on imprinting and homing in Pacific salmon.

His postdoctoral research included the study of the ecology of the pathogenic bacterium *Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae*. For the last year and a half, Oleksandr worked as a visiting researcher in the laboratory of Professor Flaminia Catteruccia at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (USA). There he participated in the study of the interaction between *Anopheles gambiae* and the malaria pathogen Plasmodium. At UBC, Oleksandr will be working on generating genetic tools to investigate the links between olfaction and immunity in *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes. <br/> <br/>
