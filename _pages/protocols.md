{: #CRISPR }

[CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of Aedes aegypti](/assets/pdf/CRISPR.pdf)
This protocol was originally published as a bench manual to accompany Kistler, Vosshall, and Matthews (2015), and is updated to reflect our current methodology for generating mutations in *Aedes aegypti* using CRISPR/Cas9. 

{: #pBac }

[piggyBac-mediated transformation of *Aedes aegypti*](/assets/pdf/Aedes_pBac.pdf)
This protocol describes how to generate mRNA for piggyBac transposase and provides guidance on injection mixes for efficient transposon-mediated transformation of *Aedes aegypti*.
