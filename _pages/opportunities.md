##Join us?
We are always on the lookout for passionate and curious scientists at all levels. If you're interested in working with us as an undergraduate or graduate student, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a CV and a brief description of why you're interested in the lab. Candidates at the postdoctoral level should [email Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) a CV, contact information for three references, and a brief proposal for a postdoctoral project.


##Citizen Science:
We are currently running a project, led by Dr. Dan Peach and Joshua Chen, aimed at identifying mosquitoes using genome sequencing and DNA barcoding, and we need your help!  Please see more details [here](assets/pdf/whatbitme.pdf) on how you can provide samples for this project aimed at understanding what species of mosquito are where across the Pacific Northwest!
