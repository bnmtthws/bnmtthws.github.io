## Join us?
We are always on the lookout for passionate and curious scientists at all levels. If you're interested in working with us as an undergraduate or graduate student, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a CV and a brief description of why you're interested in the lab. Candidates at the postdoctoral level should [email Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) a CV, contact information for three references, and a brief proposal for a postdoctoral project.

We are currently hiring a technician and lab manager as part, with a closing date of July 1 and a start date of September 1, 2023. The position is fully funded for up to three years. 


## Citizen Science:
We recently ran a project, led by Dr. Dan Peach, Joshua Chen, and Danica Shannon, aimed at identifying mosquitoes using genome sequencing and DNA barcoding.  We are currently processing the data and aim to make it publicly available as soon as we can.  

Thank you all for the wonderful response to this project! [We've received thousands of mosquitoes from all over BC](http://mosquitolab.zoology.ubc.ca/assets/whatbitme/) and are now only accepting samples from the Central Coast, North Coast, Stikine, Peace River, and Kootney regions. We are currently processing the samples that have been sent in, but due to the overwhelming numbers that were submitted this is taking longer than anticipated. Thank you for your submissions and your patience!
