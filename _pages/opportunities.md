## Join us?

### Undergraduate students:
We routinely take directed studies and honours students from UBC Biology, Integrated Science, Psychology, and other programs. If you are interested in working with us, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a brief description of past laboratory experiences (no specific experience is required!), timeline, and a short description of what you hope to get out of your time in the lab. This will help me determine whether there is a good fit between your interests and any of the ongoing projects within the lab.

### Graduate students: 
At the graduate level, our research group is currently full and is not accepting new students for the 2023-2024 academic year. If your timeline fits with a fall 2024 start date, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a CV and a brief description of why you're interested in the lab. We take M.Sc. and Ph.D. students through the following programs: [Zoology](https://zoology.ubc.ca/graduate-program/prospective-students), [Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.ubc.ca/), and [Genome Sciences and Technology](https://www.msl.ubc.ca/join-us/#gsat).

### Postdoctoral researchers: 
Candidates at the postdoctoral level should [email Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) a CV, contact information for three references, and a brief proposal for a postdoctoral project. As a postdoctoral candidate, you will be expected to identify and apply for external funding (e.g. HFSP, NSERC, CIHR, Michael Smith). Before reaching out, you should research these mechanisms and present a timeline for applying to those for which you are eligible.

### Research staff:
We are currently hiring a full-time [technician and lab manager](https://ubc.wd10.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/ubcstaffjobs/job/Research-Assistant--Technician-2_JR13001), with a closing date of July 1 and a start date of September 1, 2023. The position is fully funded for up to three years.



## Citizen Science:
We recently began a project, led by Dr. Dan Peach (now at University of Georgia), Joshua Chen, and Danica Shannon, aimed at identifying mosquitoes using genome sequencing and DNA barcoding.  We are currently processing the data and aim to make it publicly available as soon as we can.  

Thank you all for the wonderful response to this project! [We've received thousands of mosquitoes from all over BC](http://mosquitolab.zoology.ubc.ca/assets/whatbitme/) and are now only accepting samples from the Central Coast, North Coast, Stikine, Peace River, and Kootney regions. We are currently processing the samples that have been sent in, but due to the overwhelming numbers that were submitted this is taking longer than anticipated. Thank you for your submissions and your patience!
