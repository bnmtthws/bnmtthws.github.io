## Join us?

### Undergraduate students:
We routinely take directed studies and honours students from UBC Biology, Integrated Science, Psychology, and other programs. If you are interested in working with us, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a brief description of past laboratory experiences (no specific experience is required!), timeline, and a short description of what you hope to get out of your time in the lab. This will help me determine whether there is a good fit between your interests and any of the ongoing projects spearheaded by graduate students and postdocs.

Here are specific projects for 2025WT, beginning September 2025:

~~1) Seeking an enthusiastic student to test how host crowding in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) impacts the infection rate of the parasitic hairworm Paragordius varius. This is a hands-on opportunity to gain experience in experimental design, parasitology, and behavioral ecology. Ideal for students interested in host-parasite interactions and invertebrate biology.~~

2) The yellow-fever mosquito is a vector of several deadly diseases, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. Developing a better understanding of their biology can help reduce the spread of these diseases. My research focuses on how mosquitoes perceive the world through the lens of touch. Touch is a crucial sense in many fitness-related behaviours in the yellow fever mosquito and notably plays an important role in egg-laying behaviour. The yellow-fever mosquito uses touch to assess egg-laying location, preferring to lay its eggs on rougher surfaces and in small grooves above the water surface.
I am looking for a student to help characterize the “what, why and how” of touch-mediated egg-laying behaviour in these mosquitoes. The timeline for this project is preferably 14-16 weeks (two terms), but can be completed in 6-8 weeks (one term). The student can choose to conduct one of the following experiments: 1) filming macro-scale egg-laying behaviour or 2) running two-choice egg-laying behaviour assays. Both experiments teach how to rear mosquitoes, conduct behaviour experiments and analyze data.

~~3) Mosquitoes rely on both smell and taste to locate and evaluate hosts, guiding their biting and blood-feeding behavior. Our lab studies how appetitive and aversive cues influence these decisions and is seeking a student to contribute to one of two projects. Project 1 examines how bitter taste affects feeding by comparing wildtype Aedes aegypti mosquitos to GR14 receptor mutants, which are thought to lack aversive responses to bitter compounds. Project 2 involves conducting two-choice olfactory (smell) assays testing mosquito attraction to lactic acid, a key human skin odor against control substrates. Both projects provide hands-on experience in mosquito husbandry, behavioral assays, experimental design, and data analysis while contributing to our understanding of mosquito host-seeking and blood-feeding behaviour.~~

### Graduate students:

At the graduate level, our research group is full and is not accepting new students for the 2025-2026 academic year. If your timeline fits with a fall 2026 or later start date, please send an email to [Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) with a recent CV, contact information for three references, and a brief description of why you're interested in the lab. We can take M.Sc. and Ph.D. students through the following programs: [Zoology](https://zoology.ubc.ca/graduate-program/prospective-students), [Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.ubc.ca/), and [Genome Sciences and Technology](https://www.msl.ubc.ca/join-us/#gsat).

### Postdoctoral researchers: 
Candidates at the postdoctoral level should [email Ben](mailto:ben.matthews@zoology.ubc.ca) a CV, contact information for three references, and a brief proposal for a postdoctoral project. As a postdoctoral candidate, you will be expected to identify and apply for external funding (e.g. HFSP, NSERC, CIHR, Michael Smith). Before reaching out, you should research these mechanisms and present a timeline for applying to those for which you are eligible.

## Citizen Science:
We recently began a project, led by Dr. Dan Peach (now at University of Georgia), Joshua Chen, and Danica Shannon, aimed at identifying mosquitoes using genome sequencing and DNA barcoding. We want to sincerely thank you all for the wonderful response to this project, and provide a quick update. [We've received thousands of mosquitoes from all over BC](http://mosquitolab.zoology.ubc.ca/assets/whatbitme/) and for the coming year are only accepting samples from the Central Coast, North Coast, Stikine, Peace River, and Kootney regions. We are currently processing the samples that have been sent in, but due to the overwhelming numbers that were submitted this is taking longer than anticipated. Thank you for your submissions and your patience!
