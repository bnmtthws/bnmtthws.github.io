We are in desparate need of re-vamping our laboratory name - no longer simply the 'mosquito lab', we also work on host-parasite interactions in a cricket-hairworm system (driven by [Dr. Jeff Doherty](http://mosquitolab.zoology.ubc.ca/people/#jeff)) and now fish, as part of a collaborative project with Colin Brauner's lab. We welcome two new M.Sc. students, Eric Reich and Ralitza Sevova, who will join [Dr. Ian Bouyoucos](http://mosquitolab.zoology.ubc.ca/people/#ian) to study the impacts of water acidification on olfactory imprinting in Pacific Salmon. It took 4 years, but we've got the fish bug!
