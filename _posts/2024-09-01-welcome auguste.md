A very warm welcome to Auguste de Pennart, joining us as a Zoology PhD student. Auguste did his undergraduate work at UBC, followed by a M.Sc. degree with [Maria Dacke](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/marie-dacke) in the Lund University Vision group. 

Auguste will be working on mechanosensation in *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes.
