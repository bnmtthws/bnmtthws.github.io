A hearty welcome to Bridget White, joining us as a research technician after finishing her M.Sc. degree from the University of Manitoba! Bridget's position is funded by our HFSP project on the olfactory-immune connection in *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes, and will be tasked with keeping our dozens of genetically distinct mosquito strains in tip top shape.  Welcome!
