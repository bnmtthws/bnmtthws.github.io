Congratulations to Dan Peach on his first ever bioRxiv pre-print, [Modelling the Putative Ancient Distribution of the Costal Rock Pool Mosquito _Aedes togoi_][bioRxiv]. A very cool study that uses climate modeling to predict where (and when) _Aedes togoi_ might be found.  We're excited to see what team togoi comes up with next!
