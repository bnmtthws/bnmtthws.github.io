The lab is thrilled to be funded by the [Canadian Institutes of Health Research](https://research.ubc.ca/ubc-researchers-leading-projects-awarded-313-million-through-cihr-project-grants-fall-2023) (with fantastic colleague [Mike Gordon and his lab](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~gordon/)) to study mosquito sensory systems. This grant represents a huge amount of work by the lab to get the lab off the ground over the past few years - what a great group, and can't wait to see what they do next!
