A big Mosquito Lab welcome (back) to Jonathan Chiang, a former co-op student who is returning to pursue an M.Sc. in the [Genome Sciences and Technology program](https://www.msl.ubc.ca/join-us/#gsat). Jonathan will be working on genome assembly and annotation of mosquitoes and other insects of interest!
