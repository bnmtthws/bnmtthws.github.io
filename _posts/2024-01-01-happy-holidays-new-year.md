The UBC mosquito lab capped off an excellent 2023, seeing the first graduate student finish their degree (congratulations Orna!), welcoming several new members (hi Bridget and Ian and Jonathan!), and seeing the start of several new collaborative projects.

To celebrate, the lab started had a sushi, pie, and white elephant party followed by a new tradition: painting one of the concrete pillars in the lab, with the touch-up crew coming in a day later to make sure their work was up to snuff.

Happy holidays!
