We are very pleased to announce that Ben was selected as a [2021  Scholar](https://www.msfhr.org/1/award_researcher/benjamin-matthews) by the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research to support work in the lab for the next five years. We are grateful to MSFHR for the support and so happy that this will allow us to continue to expand the directions of the lab's work!
