Our role as a member of the Council of Canadian Academies' [The Expert Panel on Regulating Gene-Edited Organisms for Pest Control](https://rapports-cac.ca/reports/gene-edited-organisms-for-pest-control/) resulted in a report entitled [Framing Challenges and Opportunities for Canada](https://rapports-cac.ca/reports/gene-edited-organisms-for-pest-control/). Ben was interviewed on the podcast [The Big Story](https://thebigstorypodcast.ca/2023/11/27/we-can-genetically-modify-pests-but-should-we/) to share his views on the report and the pros and cons associated with using gene editing for pest control.
