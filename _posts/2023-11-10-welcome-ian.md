After starting up at UBC, the lab could only avoid working on fish for so long... A hearty welcome to Dr. Ian Bouyoucos, joining our lab as a postdoctoral fellow and working on a project funded by the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund (BCSRIF), investigating the roles of water acidification and habitat on imprinting and homing in Pacific salmon. Welcome Ian!
