Congratulations to the Mosquito Lab's first Masters graduate, Orna Phelan, who defended her thesis in style today. Orna's thesis was entitled "An investigation into the salinity tolerance, oviposition behavior and breeding habitat ecology of a widespread (*Aedes aegypti*) and restricted (*Aedes togoi*) mosquito species"

The entire lab wishes Orna the best on her new adventure as a wildlife biologist in the Northwest Territories - if you catch any cool bugs let us know!
