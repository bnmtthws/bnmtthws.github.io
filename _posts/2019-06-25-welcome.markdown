Welcome to the new home of the (Ben) Matthews lab in the [Department of Zoology][zoo] at the [University of British Columbia][ubc].  The physical doors will open in September, but we are here now.

Of note: there are two Matthews labs in the department, and, quite confusingly, we both work on insects. If you're looking for the *original* Matthews Lab (Phil Matthews) at UBC Zoology, you can find his website [here](http://matthewslab.zoology.ubc.ca).
