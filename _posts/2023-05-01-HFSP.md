The lab is excited to announce a successful funding application to the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP). This [three-year award](https://www.hfsp.org/sites/default/files/webfm/Grants/2023%20RG%20List%20for%20Web%20announcement.pdf) is in collaboration with Tina Mukherjee, Jo√£o Marques, and Mario Rucker, and is concerned with understanding the link between olfaction and the mosquito immune system. 

Stay tuned for an advertisement for a PhD student or postdoctoral researcher to work on this exciting project in close collaboration with the full team. In addition, please see an ad for a [research technician](https://ubc.wd10.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/ubcstaffjobs/job/Research-Assistant--Technician-2_JR13001) beginning September 1 to support this project.
