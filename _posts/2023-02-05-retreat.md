Big thanks to Jeff Doherty for getting us organized for the first Mosquito Lab 'working retreat.' We found a nice spot nestled at the base of the mountains and had some fun while writing a review on the sensory mechanisms that a arboviral or other parasite might poke and prod to manipulate mosquito behaviour, currently under review at *Trends in Parasitology*.
