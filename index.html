<p><i>Aedes aeygpti</i> mosquitoes are deadly vectors of the arboviral pathogens that cause Dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika and Chikungunya. Our lab is interested in understanding how the genome of mosquitoes and other insects encode the ability to perform adaptive behaviors, including blood-feeding and selecting suitable egg-laying sites. We utilize a broad range of techniques from genomics, genetics, neurobiology, and behavior to address these questions.
